# Would You Rather Project

The "Would You Rather?" app is a React/Redux front end application, where users can play the "Would You Rather?" game: A user is asked a question in the form "Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?". Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. Users are able to answer questions, see which questions they havenâ€™t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard. Login is required before accessing the game. 

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data, consisting in users and questions.
